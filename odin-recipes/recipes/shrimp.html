    <h3>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Separate garlic cloves into a bowl; place another 
        bowl on top. Shake until all peels separate from cloves, 
        about 30 seconds, being careful not to shake too hard. 
        Mince garlic cloves.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Melt butter in a saut√© pan over medium heat; 
        add minced garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 
        2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a small bowl and set aside.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Pat thawed shrimp dry with paper towels; add to a large mixing bowl.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Combine rice flour, paprika, salt, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl; sprinkle over shrimp and toss until completely coated using a large spoon or spatula.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp in a single layer, in batches, and cook until browned and just barely cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add some garlic butter; cook for 30 seconds more. Repeat with remaining shrimp and garlic butter. Serve immediately.
