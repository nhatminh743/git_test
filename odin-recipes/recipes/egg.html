    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat oven to 450Â°F. On rimmed baking sheet, toss tomatoes with 1 tablespoon oil, smoked paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Roast until tomatoes start to release liquid and break down, 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, using mortar and pestle,  crush <em>coriander and cumin seeds</em> until coarsely ground.</li>
        <li>When tomatoes are ready, sprinkle evenly with feta. Using back of spoon, create 8 wells (1 for each egg) in tomatoes, then sprinkle with ground coriander and cumin seeds. Bake until cheese is slightly melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Crack 1 egg into each well and bake until egg whites are just set, 3 to 5 minutes more. Sprinkle with basil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in large bowl, whisk lemon juice with remaining <strong>Tbsp oil.</strong> Add greens and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and toss to coat. Serve alongside baked eggs with toast.</li>
    </ul>
